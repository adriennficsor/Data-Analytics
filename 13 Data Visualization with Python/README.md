This project focuses on analyzing the Coursera Course Dataset using Python, building on skills developed in data visualization and analysis. The goal is to explore the dataset iteratively, generate meaningful insights, and communicate findings effectively through clear explanations and visualizations.

# Objectives:
Practice working with Kaggle datasets.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with minimal explicit requirements, leveraging critical thinking and hypothesis testing.
Use data visualization tools to support analysis and communicate results.
# Key Steps:
## Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, ensuring consistent formatting, and addressing any duplicates or outliers.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset to answer key questions such as:
What are the most popular courses on Coursera?
What is the distribution of course difficulty levels?
Are there trends in course ratings and enrollments across categories?
How does course pricing vary by subject area?
Are certain providers dominant in specific fields or categories?
Used hypothesis-driven exploration to identify patterns and trends.
## Data Visualization:

Created compelling visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to uncover and illustrate trends in the dataset.
Examples of visualizations include distribution plots, bar charts, and heatmaps for categorical and numerical data comparisons.
## Insights and Recommendations:

Delivered clear explanations of the findings, addressing what the results reveal about the Coursera course catalog.
Highlighted actionable insights, such as which categories or providers may drive user engagement or profitability.
# Suggestions for Improvement:

Recommended areas for deeper analysis, including tracking trends over time, incorporating external datasets (e.g., global education trends), and examining user feedback to enhance course offerings.
# Tools Used:
