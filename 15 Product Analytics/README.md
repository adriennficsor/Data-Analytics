This project focuses on analyzing the time it takes for users to make their first purchase on the website after their initial arrival on any given day. The objective is to provide insights into user behavior and identify daily patterns in the purchase duration.

# Objectives:
Determine the time duration between users' first arrival on the website and their first purchase on the same day.
Present the daily dynamics of purchase duration through visualization and storytelling.
Provide analytical insights and recommendations for future analysis.
# Key Steps:
## Data Extraction:

Used SQL to query the turing_data_analytics.raw_events table from BigQuery.
Extracted data capturing user sessions, timestamps for first website arrival, and first purchase events.
Computed the time difference between these events to calculate purchase duration for each user.
## Data Visualization:

Imported the queried data into Power BI to create visualizations highlighting daily purchase duration dynamics.
Designed dashboards showcasing trends, outliers, and patterns in user purchase behavior over time.
Exported visuals to PowerPoint to create an engaging and accessible presentation.
## Insights from Exploration:

Identified variations in purchase durations across different days, possibly influenced by factors such as promotions, website performance, or user demographics.
Discovered notable trends or anomalies that provided additional context to the data.
## Enhancements to Presentation:

Applied advanced Power BI techniques to make visuals intuitive and impactful, such as dynamic filtering and annotated visuals.
Focused on clear storytelling to guide stakeholders through the analysis findings.
# Analytical Insights and Recommendations:

Highlighted the key findings, such as average purchase duration and daily fluctuations.
Discussed the limitations of the analysis, including:
Potential inaccuracies due to incomplete data or missing timestamps.
Proposed further analysis, such as:
Examining the impact of marketing campaigns or website changes on purchase duration.
Segmenting users by demographics or purchase categories for deeper insights.
# Tools Used:
SQL: To query and preprocess data from BigQuery.
Power BI: For data visualization and dynamic dashboard creation.
PowerPoint: To deliver findings in a clear and professional presentation format.
