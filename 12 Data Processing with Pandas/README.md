This project involves analyzing the Spotify Top 50 Tracks 2020 dataset to uncover insights into what makes a hit song. The analysis aims to answer a series of questions provided by the product manager, leveraging Python and Pandas for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# Objectives:
Practice working with real-world datasets from Kaggle.
Develop skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Answer specific business questions related to hit songs using the dataset.
# Key Steps:
## Data Loading and Cleaning:

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Addressed missing values, removed duplicate samples and features, and treated outliers.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Answered detailed questions such as:
Number of observations and features.
Identification of categorical and numerical features.
Artists and albums with multiple hits.
Popularity rankings of artists and genres.
Track-specific characteristics (e.g., danceability, loudness, length).
Correlations between features.
Genre-based comparisons for features like danceability, loudness, and acousticness.
## Insights and Visualizations:

Used descriptive statistics and visualizations to present findings clearly.
Highlighted strongly positive, negative, and uncorrelated feature relationships.
Compared key metrics across genres like Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie.
## Suggestions for Improvement:

Suggested steps for refining the analysis, including integrating more detailed genre classifications, investigating trends across years, and comparing with other datasets for validation.
