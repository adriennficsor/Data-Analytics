This project involves analyzing the Cardiovascular Study Dataset and applying predictive modeling techniques using logistic regression. The goal is to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on patient attributes, emphasizing metric selection and threshold optimization.

# Objectives:
Develop predictive modeling skills using logistic regression.
Practice working with medical datasets to predict binary outcomes.
Optimize classification thresholds based on appropriate evaluation metrics.
# Key Steps:
## Data Loading and Preparation:

Loaded the train.csv dataset using Pandas.
Inspected the dataset for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Cleaned the data to ensure suitability for logistic regression analysis.
Separated training and testing datasets.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examined the relationships between predictors and the target variable.
Visualized key features to identify trends and insights (e.g., correlations, distributions).
## Logistic Regression Modeling:

Implemented a logistic regression model to predict the 10-year risk of CHD.
Interpreted the model's coefficients and derived odds ratios to understand the impact of predictors.
# Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using various classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
Compared the performance of the model using these metrics to determine the most appropriate evaluation method for the problem.
# Threshold Optimization:

Identified the optimal classification threshold based on the balance between precision and recall.
# Insights and Recommendations:

Discussed the implications of the analysis, including which patient attributes are most predictive of CHD risk.
Highlighted potential use cases of the model in real-world clinical settings.

Tools Used:
Python 3.7
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
