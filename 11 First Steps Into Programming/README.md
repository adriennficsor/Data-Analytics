# Project Overview
This project implements a Python (Python 3.12.4) program that evaluates a given chess board state and determines which black pieces a white piece can capture. The program supports up to 16 black pieces and one white piece, with interactive input for specifying the board configuration.

# Features
## Interactive Input:

The user inputs the type and position of the white chess piece (e.g., knight a5).
The user adds up to 16 black pieces one by one in the same format.
Users can end the input process by typing done after adding at least one black piece.
## Validation:

Validates each input for correctness (e.g., format and position constraints).
Provides feedback on successful additions or errors in the input.
## Chess Logic:

The program determines which black pieces the white piece can capture based on chess rules.
Supports logic for two white piece types chosen for this project.
## Output:

After all inputs are received, the program displays the black pieces that the white piece can potentially take.
